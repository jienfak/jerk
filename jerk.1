.It Fl i Ar file
Set
.Ar file
as the directory index.
The default is "index.html".
.It Fl l
Enable directory listing.
.It Fl m Ar map
Add the target prefix mapping rule specified by
.Ar map ,
which has the form
.Qq Pa from to [chost] ,
where each element is separated with spaces (0x20) that can be
escaped with '\\'.
.Pp
The prefix
.Pa from
of all matching targets is replaced with
.Pa to ,
optionally limited to the canonical virtual host
.Pa chost .
If no virtual hosts are given,
.Pa chost
is ignored.
.It Fl n Ar num
Set the maximum number of threads to
.Ar num .
The default is 512.
.It Fl p Ar port
In host mode, listen on port
.Ar port
for incoming connections.
In socket mode, use
.Ar port
for constructing proper virtual host
redirects on non-standard ports.
.It Fl U Ar file
Create the UNIX-domain socket
.Ar file ,
listen on it for incoming connections and remove it on exit.
.It Fl u Ar user
Set user ID when dropping privileges,
and in socket mode the user of the socket file,
to the ID of
.Ar user .
The default is "nobody".
.It Fl v Ar vhost
Add the virtual host specified by
.Ar vhost ,
which has the form
.Qq Pa chost regex dir [prefix] ,
where each element is separated with spaces (0x20) that can be
escaped with '\\'.
.Pp
A request matching the virtual host regular expression
.Pa regex
(see
.Xr regex 3 )
is redirected to the canonical host
.Pa chost ,
if they differ, using the directory
.Pa dir
as the root directory, optionally prefixing the target with
.Pa prefix .
If any virtual hosts are specified, all requests on non-matching
hosts are discarded.

.Sh CUSTOMIZATION
.Nm
can be customized by creating a custom config.h from config.def.h and
(re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
